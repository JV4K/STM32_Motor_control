# STM32_Motor_control
PID controller and encoder processing project.

This project is a result of my University project. My friend and I are developing a mecanum-wheels laboratory platform.

Content:
1. reg.h/.c files, which contain PID-controller structure and functions
2. encoder_assert.h/.c files, which contain a rotary encoder structure and functions

Features:
1. Rotary encoder position and speed assertion based on it's CPR
2. PID-controller (P,PI,PD, etc.)
